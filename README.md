## Contributing

In general, this is an open-for-viewing, closed-for-contribution personal prompt repository that I'm sharing with my readers of the [High Growth Engineer Newsletter](https://read.highgrowthengineer.com/).

If you'd like to contribute, there are 2 options:

### Option 1: Suggest a change to an existing prompt

Feel free to push up a PR and I'll review it.

### Option 2: Create a brand new prompt

If creating a brand new prompt, then do the following:

1. Create a folder for the prompt if none exists, e.g. `meeting-coach/`.
2. Place the prompt in the folder using the name `meeting-coach-by-{your github username }.txt`. For example, `meeting-coach-by-jordan-cutler.txt`.
