<sample 1>
For the past month, I’ve been using a tool I avoided for a really long time. And wow do I regret holding off as long as I did.

The tool is called Raycast, and it’s a replacement for the MacOS Spotlight and Alfred—the “command + space” command bar desktop apps. I first learned about it when writing about my productivity workflow over a year ago and one of the comments mentioned Raycast.

If you’re not familiar with these types of tools, it’s essentially a “shortcut to everything,” as Raycast describes it. You can use it to open apps, manage windows, talk to AI, access your clipboard history, run mini tools and programs, and plenty more. It might sound confusing, but it’ll make sense shortly.

We’re going to dive into 7 use cases today that I’ve used as a Senior Engineer in big tech to save me hours per week.

Note: I haven’t been in contact with anyone at Raycast. They don’t know about this blog post, and I’m not being sponsored. I will share an affiliate link but purely because it gives you a discount if you decide to try it. My intent, as with all my posts, is to give you as much value as possible.

1) Emoji picker
You might use the native MacOS emoji picker via `cmd + ctrl + space`. If you do, you know how bad it can be sometimes. Either it takes forever to pop up, it doesn’t work for a given site (like Google Docs), or when you select an emoji nothing happens. Overall, it’s pretty bad.

When I saw people who use Raycast talk about the emoji picker, I was confused about why they were hyping up a simple emoji picker—until I tried it.

It pops up instantly with no lag ever

You can use natural language with AI to search for emojis

You can pin the ones you use the most

Emoji picker
2) Instant AI Chat
Every day, you have random questions that pop up.

For example,

What’s the git command to do < some complicated thing >?

What’s the PostgreSQL syntax for naming a subquery?

How can I center a div in CSS?

But you also don’t have time to open up a new tab, go to ChatGPT’s website, wait for it to load, then ask your question.

Instead, you want AI right at your fingertips. The AI chat feature is by far my most used feature of Raycast. Whenever I have a quick question like the ones above, I’m one keyboard shortcut away from AI.

They have this “Quick AI Chat” feature where you can just ask directly from the command bar. I just used it today when I wasn’t sure what some of my old VSCode settings were meant to do.

I hit “Cmd + Space” to open Raycast, then “Tab” to open the AI chat, wrote my quick question, and got it answered instantly.

Using the Quick AI Chat
You can even ask follow-ups afterward and continue in a larger chat window. I use this all the time when I want to quickly know what a niche command is, why I’m getting a certain error, or to further explain documentation that I copy-paste in.

3) AI Presets
Nowadays, AI prompts are a commodity. You might come across them in a tutorial, course, blog post, etc. And the good ones are gold. They can save you tons of time by doing things like:

Writing a PRD, 1-pager, or script for you

Summarize content into structured notes

Rewrite a messy transcript rehearsal into an easy-to-follow script

And plenty more. AI Presets are the place where you can store all these use cases.

For example, I have a PRD generator prompt (I think from Peter Yang — thanks Peter 🙇‍♂️) that I saved as a preset and can quickly use any time I want. I’m actually planning on using it to generate a PRD for a separate tool idea I have.

My AI presets
Another one I love is the “Edit Rehearsal Transcript” preset. You can generate a script by practicing. First, practice your presentation and generate a transcript via an app like MacWhisper, then feed it into this prompt which will refine your whole script.

edit rehearsal script
The next time you present, you can use the refined script and not worry about making any mistakes while presenting!

4) Text expanders
Every day, there are so many things you type which shouldn’t take as much time as it does. That’s where text expanders come in.

They’re little mini snippets of text that “expand” into longer snippets.

Here are some examples of what I use:

\log → console.log({ cursorPosition })

\email → my email

\li → my LinkedIn profile URL

\resume → my resume URL

\cal → my Calendly link for scheduling

\decline → A standard declining of new opportunities message

\ai:mermaid → Standard instructions for creating a mermaid diagram based on the notes I share afterward.

\gh-table → Content for creating a table in Markdown since they’re a pain to write by hand.

Text expanders
One of the cool ways it’s better than the native text expanders is the built-in variables. You can control where to send the cursor after, use clipboard text, compose snippets, and more. It’s super powerful and saves you a ton of time typing.

5) Quicklinks
Quicklinks are like bookmarks, but even better. You can access them from the command palette, make a keyboard shortcut, and use variables.

The simplest example is Google searching.

With a quicklink aliased to “g”, I can open the command palette, type “g”, then write what I want to search. It does this by sending whatever I type to the query param in the google search URL.

Quick link google example
While this is a simple example, I do this for other things like our code search tool that accepts query arguments to quickly grep across all parts of the codebase.

6) Integrations
You might have spotted in the above screenshot, there’s plenty other tools and integrations you can use.

One integration I like is a quick Giphy search like this:

Accessing giphy quickly
You can quickly add these anywhere—in Slack, on pull requests, as a comment on LinkedIn, in an email, in a doc, etc.
Another integration I use all the time is OCR (Capture text), which allows you to quickly screenshot anything and extract the text from it.

This is great when someone is moving fast in a presentation and you don’t have time to take notes. I also use it for grabbing long links off of screenshots. Finally, it’s good for reading articles like this. You could grab the text from any of the prior screenshots without needing to type it yourself. Here’s a gif of that in action:

Using OCR to capture any text from an image
All I need to do is type “ocr” from Raycast and it will pop up. It works directly with CleanShot.

7) Infinite Clipboard History
As engineers, copy-paste knows no bounds. It’s our bread and butter. Raycast comes with an “infinite clipboard history” so you can always search for things you’ve copy-pasted in the past.

In some cases, this has changed my whole workflow and saved me hours of time.

One time, I introduced a piece of code that made over a hundred tests fail. They all needed the same fix to them, but I also needed to go to each file and make the fix manually. It involved me copying a file name, going to that file, then adding the same snippet every time. Because of the clipboard history, I could easily grab the snippet I needed to paste after navigating to the file.

1) Use a framework
When you write, you have time to structure your thoughts. One of the best ways to add structure is to use a framework. Frameworks are “packages of structure,” often with scientific backing which structure your thoughts into a narrative.

Here’s an example from a past article where I share how Alex Chiou uses the “Problem-Agitate-Solution” framework to achieve his goal in his LinkedIn post:

Alex Chiou using Problem-Agitate-Solution framework
Link to post from Alex
Problem-Agitate-Solution is one example framework, but there are others, like Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF). I wrote about BLUF in my Guide to Leading Meetings. Here’s the excerpt…

Using BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) ensures people hear your message.

BLUF framework. Start with the answer, then supporting arguments, then supporting data
Start with what you need, then add supporting context
The idea is to start with what you need rather than providing a ton of context, allowing people to get lost, and then only putting your ask at the end.

Below is an example of not using BLUF. It’s hard to understand what I’m asking.

Unclear message of what the action is
Not using BLUF. The message is unclear and long ❌
Compare this to converting using BLUF below.

Clear message of the action using BLUF
Using BLUF, the “ask” is much clearer ✅
A few other writing frameworks are:

General purpose

The facts (What) → Why it matters → Now what

Getting buy-in

Problem → Solution → Benefit

Point → Reason → Example → Repeat your point

Storytelling

Freytags pyramid: Exposition → Rising action → Climax → Falling action → Resolution

It’s good to have a repertoire of these you can pull from.

Examples for every framework would make the article too long. However, to give you something, here is a quick set of examples from GPT.

If you want to learn more about frameworks, I recommend watching Vicky Zhao or reading Farnam Street.

2) Cut. Cut. Cut ✂️
Use fewer words. Assume every word has a cost and you’re paying for each one you use. Then try to spend less!

One of my favorite quotes about writing is:

“If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.”

Once you finish your initial “draft,” wait! Don’t hit send. Read it over and shorten it. You can usually make your content 30% shorter and retain the same message.

Three ways I do this are:

(1) Replace groups of words with a single word

❌ is able to

✅ can

(2) Shorten groups of words using a stronger verb

❌ make it shorter

✅ shorten it

(3) Look for words and sentences I can delete because they don’t provide value

❌ If you want to learn more about frameworks in general, I recommend watching Vicky Zhao.

These examples are straight from my editing process in this article. You can even search this article for each of the “after” states.

3) Use Grammarly and Hemingway
This tip is actually, “Use proper grammar,” but that felt obvious. You should use proper grammar, but grammar is hard. Even as a native English speaker, I mess up my English a lot 😂.

I purchased Grammarly Pro and have never looked back. Some of its advice is bad, but I like how it provides a lot of specific, actionable feedback. I agree with about 75% of the feedback it gives me.

If you’d like a free month of Grammarly Pro, you can use my referral link.

Hemingway is another tool I use to check the readability score.

Here’s a screenshot of this article inside Hemingway. The “Readability score” is 4. A lower-number score means it’s readable to a broader audience. I aim for a score of less than 8.

View of hemingway and the 4 readability score
This article when put in Hemingway. Readability score of 4 which is good
4) Avoid passive voice
I was so confused about passive voice for the longest time. It’s still hard for me to recognize it sometimes, but Grammarly helps a ton.

Passive voice is when you lead with the verb, rather than the noun.

To use “active voice” instead of “passive voice,” lead with the person (noun) performing the action (verb).

Here are a few examples with the noun and verb bolded:

❌ I was told by Sean

✅ Sean told me

❌ The doc was written by the performance team

✅ The performance team wrote the doc

❌ The data was analyzed by Christina

✅ Christina analyzed the data

When you read the passive version, your brain converts it to the active version, so by writing in the active voice, you’re forcing your reader to do less work.

To learn more about active vs. passive voice, check Google’s guide on it.

5) Write short sentences
Use short sentences. It’s one of the best ways to improve your readability score. A formula I use is “1 thought = 1 sentence.”

Here’s an example:

❌ While this article is mainly focused on how a mentee can make the relationship as easy as possible for the mentor, that’s not to say the mentor should just sit back and do nothing.

✅ This article’s primary focus is on how a mentee can make the relationship as easy as possible for their mentor. However, mentors should also play an active role.

In the second version, we separated two distinct thoughts into separate sentences. The first thought is “the article’s focus.” The second thought is “the mentor’s role.” Separating them made the paragraph easier to digest.

Hemingway also does a good job of highlighting long or complex sentences in yellow and red. Here’s what it looks like using the above before-and-after example.

Hemingway highlighting the before example in red and no highlighting in the after
Hemingway marked the “Before” sentence as “red”, indicating it’s complex to read
6) Break up your paragraphs
Keep paragraphs less than 5 sentences long.

I recommend using 1-3 sentence paragraphs most of the time and 4-5 sentence paragraphs sparingly.

If you want to highlight a single point, split it into its own line and paragraph. Don’t overdo it though, or else it will read like a LinkedIn post.

Long block of text
I know you probably don’t write paragraphs like the above wall of text, but the concept applies on a smaller scale too. If I notice myself writing a 4-5 sentence long paragraph, I ask myself, “What do I want the other person to take away from this?” That often leads me to delete most of what I wrote and just say that.

7) Use lists. A lot.
I recently learned the difference between an “embedded list” and a “numbered/bulleted list.”

An embedded list looks like this:

By migrating to the new system, we’ll see an improvement in perceived performance, increased throughput, and reduced error rates.

Compared to the bullet list form:

By migrating to the new system, we’ll see these benefits:

Improvement in perceived performance

Increased throughput

Reduced error rates

In general, lean toward the bullet and numbered form. Your writing should be scannable. Bullet lists are more scannable than embedded lists.

8) Use tables
This tip ventures more into “Technical Doc Writing” rather than “General Writing” but it’s a game-changer. It took me way too long to realize this, but almost every one of my technical docs or proposals includes some form of a table now.

Whenever I have repeating or comparative information, I’ll turn it into a table.

Let’s say you have a bullet list like this:

Project Tuna

Status: In progress

Priority: High

Estimate: 3 weeks

Impact: 6M customers

Project Salmon

Status: Blocked

Priority: Medium

Estimate: 2 weeks

Impact: 1M customers

… assume more projects

This screams “turn this into a table” to me! We have repeated categories of nested bullets like “Status,” “Priority,” “Estimate,” and “Impact.”

In Google Docs, you can use “@table” to quickly make a table.
</sample 2>

<sample 3>
For 27 years of my life, I considered myself awkward. Oh wait, that’s still today 🤦‍♂️.

When I started my career, I struggled with communication a lot. I spoke like someone that just graduated college—because I did. I didn’t know how to build relationships effectively, call out problems, or collaborate well.

I did my best, but it’s taken me years of observing the best communicators to learn the communication tricks to say what you want to say while staying professional.

Today, I’ll share 7 of the most common phrases I use after years of mistakes.

Some of the phrases seem obvious, but pay attention to the lessons on why they work and how to use them effectively.

1) I noticed…
We all know feedback is hard to give.

This phrase is the best way to turn giving feedback into collaborative problem-solving.

Imagine you’re working with a coworker who is leading meetings poorly. The meetings don’t have a clear agenda or outcome.

You have at least two options:

Option 1: Hey, for this meeting, can we have an agenda and clear outcome?

I don’t recommend this. It can come off as abrasive and assumptive that an agenda and clear outcome are the right solution.

Option 2: “I noticed in meetings we end up drifting in a bunch of different directions. At times it feels like we don’t have a clear end goal. Do you observe that too?”

This is much better. The person either agrees or asks more to understand the situation. You’re now aligning on a problem to solve together.

You first need to get agreement on the problem before jumping to the solution.

Once the other person agrees on the problem, they usually come up with a solution on their own. If they don’t, they ask me for ideas. At that point, I’d share the idea about an agenda and a clear outcome.

It didn’t feel like feedback to the other person. We were solving a problem together.


Here are a few more use cases:

“I noticed you have been quiet in meetings lately. Is everything ok?”

“I noticed your Slack announcements use one paragraph as the whole message. Have you considered splitting it up a bit to make the actions for each person clear?”

“I noticed you sent multiple after-hours messages recently compared to before.”

In the last one, I removed the question to show it can work without one.

Sometimes, you can pause after your observation and see if the other person jumps in. Usually, they understand what you’re getting at and it turns into a discussion.

2) Thank you for…
I say “thank you” a lot.

Why? It doesn’t get said enough!

Recently, I received a big “THANK YOU” message after a mentoring 1:1, and it instantly changed my mood.

Saying thank you more often is one of the easiest ways to build and maintain relationships.

Here’s where I say “thank you” most:

When receiving feedback, I start with, “Thank you for that feedback.”

Before and after getting help from a teammate or cross-functional stakeholder.

I say “thank you in advance” when asking for help.

After getting help, I say, “Thank you again! This was so helpful.”

Following up on a suggestion I received, saying how I implemented it and how helpful it was. I re-thank them.

“By the way, your suggestion for <x> worked perfectly. Thanks again!”

The value of the “thank you” comes back to you, especially if you do it in public. People are more inclined to continue to help you if you show appreciation and if they benefit from it—like having public kudos which builds their brand and influence.

If you want to stand out, send the kudos directly to the person’s manager. I do this when I receive standout help. This signals to the other person how much I value their help and I also do my part to ensure they get credit for it.

For more on the value of “thank you”, check this 5-minute video from Staff Engineer Alex Chiou.

3) What do you think?
I use “What do you think?” to turn a problem into a collaboration.

Here’s when I use it the most:

Real-time discussions about a design decision

“I think we could approach it this way, but I can see us hitting an edge case here. What do you think?”

Code review

“What do you think about switching <x> to <y> here so that we can get <z> benefit?”

Design doc comments

“What do you think about adding a section to cover the timeline?”

Asking for feedback about work

“Here is the email I plan to send out. What do you think?”

Other variations of this are:

“What are your thoughts?”

“What resonates most with you?”

Pro tip: Always end with your question.

❌ What do you think?

I like this one but I’m not sure about <x>

I used to do this and received negative feedback about it. It looks like you’re answering your question and don’t care about the other person’s opinion.

✅ I like this one but I’m not sure about <x>

What do you think?

Much better!

4) I agree
The easiest way to let someone’s guard down is to start with, “I agree.”

Another variation of this is, “You’re right.”

Sometimes, I get a comment on my doc that’s 90% correct and 10% wrong.

I first focus on the 90% that’s correct. Then I clarify the 10%.

✅ I agree.

There is one bit of nuance there though… <explanation>

Or

✅ Agreed on <x point>

One point of clarification on <y point> though is…

A failure mode I see is jumping at the opportunity to disagree.

For example:

❌ No, that’s not how it works.

It actually does <x>…

The above wording can trigger the other person and reduce your influence on the next thing you say.

Focus on the part you agree with first. Then align on the rest.

5) Taking that a step further…
You’re telling a joke to your friends.

One friend says, “That wasn’t funny.”

Another friend who understood it extends the joke, making everyone laugh.

You’re going to like the second friend more!

That’s the power of “Yes and.” It’s what improv artists specialize in. They always add to what you say, with a rule to never reject the premise of what someone says.

Here’s how I use it at work:

“That’s a great idea. Taking it a step further, we can do <additional thing>”

“I like that idea. I think we can expand on that more.”

“That’s great advice. I’d even recommend pushing harder on it.”

These are all cases where I agree with the idea.

If I disagree with the general idea, I’ll put a condition on it:

I think that could work if we did <x>

The “if we also did” is my “yes and.”

Here is a crazy example to show you how it works:

Coworker: I think we should rewrite our codebase in Rust

Me: I think that could work if we did a robust ROI analysis on it and determine its the best thing to spend our time on.

6) I hope you are well!
I have a rule: Never boil the frog. Don’t put a frog into boiling water immediately—it will jump out. Instead, raise the temperature slowly.

When you start a chat with someone, it begins “cold.” You need to raise the temperature slowly. This is why it’s weird to ask deep questions about someone’s personal life when you first meet them. You likely have no problem doing this with a friend, though.

Still, all interactions start cold. If you are familiar with someone, the temperature rises much faster than if you barely know them.

Because of this, if I haven’t spoken with someone for a while, I start by being friendly rather than jumping straight into the question.

✅ Hey John, I hope you are doing well!

I wanted to catch up with you about…


Now, let’s imagine I haven’t spoken to John for months and send:

❌ Hey John,

I wanted to catch up with you about…

It’s subtle, but this is more forward. The first wording is friendlier and shows an effort to build a relationship rather than jump straight to business.

A common variation I use on Mondays is:

✅ Hey Dina, I hope you had a nice weekend!

Just wanted to check-in with you on…

If you work in the office, you likely say these without thinking about it. For remote folks, all the days blend, so this is a helpful reminder 😄.

7) If I hear you correctly…
I used to work with an engineer who always said this during meetings:

“If I hear you correctly…”

“If I’m understanding you…”

“To repeat back to you what I understood…”

When he used it on me, I felt heard and understood.

I’d think to myself, “Yes, exactly! You get it! Thank you!!!”

Chris Voss’s classic book on negotiation, Never Split the Difference, describes it as “mirroring.”

Not only does the other person feel heard and understood, but you ensure you understand. In the past, I’ve used this to clarify something and found I’m either totally off base or work I thought they were asking me to do was not expected.

Asking has saved me time and built relationships.
</sample 3>

<sample 4>
You’re likely familiar with the term “code smell”—like a 4-level deep if-statement.

But I’m inventing a new term called “communication smell.” A communication smell is the same idea, except it’s when you notice a bad pattern in your communication.

One communication smell I see looks like this:

❌ We can improve the load time by caching images on a CDN.

“Improve” is vague. Would it improve by .0001 seconds, 1 second, 3 seconds?

Sure, it will improve the load time. That’s great! But what about the 20 other things that improve the load time? Why should we do this over those?

Here’s an improved version:

✅ I think we can cut the load time by 25% if we cache images on a CDN. That will take it from 3 seconds to 2.25 seconds.

The difference is communicating in deltas. There is a clear before and after:

Before: 3 seconds

After: 2.25 seconds

Improvement: 25%

Bar with 3 seconds, bar with 2.25 seconds, and a line connecting them showing 25% improvement
Before and after visualization
Communicating in deltas makes your point 5x more convincing (see, notice the 5x 😄).

It doesn’t only apply to prioritization though. In this article, I’ll show you 3 of the best places to use this strategy to grow your career.

Use case 1: Performance reviews
The most common mistake I see in performance reviews is writing unclear impact.

Here’s an example:

❌ Impact: Reduced home page load time by adding caching

It’s an okay start. It’s focused on the user outcome, not the developer output.

But there’s a key problem: Your performance review isn’t only seen by your manager. It’s also seen by their peers who have little context on the work you did.

You “reduced” page load time, but by how much?

Let’s quantify it:

🟡 Impact: Reduced home page load time by 2 seconds through additional caching

It’s better, but it’s unclear how valuable 2 seconds is.

Let’s clarify by sharing the before-and-after (delta) and tying it to team goals.

✅ Impact: Cut home page load time by 66%, from 3 seconds to 1 second through additional caching. This resulted in a 30% increase in engagement, accounting for more than half of our quarter OKR target.

Now, imagine you are a senior leader hearing about this work for the first time and reviewing this person’s performance. With the new version, you know the work done, what it looked like before, what it looks like now, and how good that is because it’s tied to the team goals.

Below, you can see the senior leaders who love this approach:

Oh, what a timely post. I am stealing the part about how much of the OKR it accounted for. I had been trying to make that point for someone and struggling with how to get there. TY!
Lauren Darcey, Senior Engineering Manager at Reddit
John calls out that the final version answers, “So what?” We know why it matters.

Provide the impact, the context and answer the question: "so what?".  Spot on Jordan.
John Crickett, ex-VP of Engineering and Author of Coding Challenges
One more bonus example: Yangshun Tay, CEO of GreatFrontend and ex-staff Engineer at Meta, shares how this same principle can be applied to resumes.

The problem is common in engineer resumes as well. I've reviewed more than a hundred resumes and this is by far the most common issue.
Yangshun Tay, ex-Staff Engineer at Meta and CEO of GreatFrontend
Resumes are often an even more concise version of performance reviews.

Share the delta. Don’t be vague!

Use case 2: Decision buy-in
Imagine you need to convince a team to adopt your new fancy framework.

How will you frame the conversation?

Would you say:

(A) Hey team, we’re working on helping teams adopt a new framework to improve the build health in CI. Can we work with you to get your team migrated?

Or

(B) Hey team, we’re working on helping teams adopt a new framework to improve the build health in CI. Right now, when developers on your team push up a PR to GitHub, it passes only 70% of the time because of build health problems. By adopting the new framework, we’d expect it to pass 99% of the time. This will give developers 1 hour per day in time back.

The first one, (A), is likely to get the answer, “I appreciate it, but we’re pretty slammed right now, so maybe next quarter?”

The second one, (B), will likely get the team jumping out of their seat asking how quickly they can migrate.

So what’s the difference?

The second one quantifies the current system, why it’s a problem, and what the new state will look like afterward. Painting that clear picture gets buy-in because it makes prioritization easy.

The other team has a million things they are balancing and trying to decide to do. Saying that the system will be “improved” isn’t clear by how much. Will it improve by .00001%? Or will it improve by 24% and give the team back a ton of time?

It’s like if a recruiter asks you, “Are you interested in a new job?” while you already have one compared to, “Are you interested in a new job? The pay is $500k per year, which is $200k higher than your current pay.” 200k higher!? Ok, let’s talk! Of course, they probably won’t know your current salary, but you get the point.

That’s what the second one communicated.

Such an important topic not just for promotions but influence through effective communication. Thanks for sharing Jordan.
Omar Halabieh, Director at Amazon Payment Services
This trick works for decisions within your team too. If you want to get something prioritized, call out the quantified change you expect.

❌ Adding <x feature> will increase revenue.

✅ Adding <x feature> will increase revenue by an estimated $4million. This will get us from 10% completion of our quarter goal to 75%.

Use case 3: Getting feedback
Getting feedback, especially from your manager or senior teammates, is one of the best ways to improve.

But it’s hard to get good feedback; especially feedback that explicitly shares how you can operate at the next level.

That’s where this pro tip comes in.

Imagine you are asking your manager for feedback on how your recent project went.

Instead of asking:

❌ How do you think I could have done better?

You can ask:

✅ How could I have executed on this project at the senior level?

In the first approach, your manager has to try hard to filter all the possible feedback they could give and whether it’s worth sharing.

In the second example, they just need to focus on what they would expect from someone at the next level compared to how you did. If they have no feedback, that’s amazing! It’s a great sign you’re already on your way to the next level. If they have feedback, you now have actionable ways to work to the next level.

Alex Chiou, co-founder of Taro and Staff Engineer, talks about this in his answer to how to drive promotion discussions.

Understand the delta

✅ I would ask something like this to your manager word-for-word: "Thanks for the feedback around my performance! For each of these points, can you give me some clear examples of what I could do to satisfy each of requirements at a senior level?"

I credit Alex with much of this article’s core idea.

You can also ask for preemptive feedback this way too.

✅ Before starting on a project: What would senior-level execution on this project look like? I want to aim for that so I can continue growing and exceed expectations.

Here are two other ways you can use this strategy:

How can this be 10% better?

What would good vs. great look like for this project?

Asking for feedback this way creates clear expectations. You’ll know exactly what you need to do to operate at the next level.

📖 TL;DR
Don’t be vague. Communicate using quantified before and after states and see the benefits in performance reviews, influence, and clear expectations.

Here are the 3 use cases discussed and the key examples:

<instructions>
Do not change the content. Only improve grammar, spelling, and sharpen the writing.

Here are the rules you must follow:
- **IMPORTANT: Keep the tone of voice same. If your edit significantly changes the tone, don't do it. Instead, note it in the <suggestions> number 4.**
- **IMPORTANT: You should not OVER-EDIT. Do not just change a sentence for the sake of editing.**
- Return in the same language as the input
- Reduce repetition
- Prefer active voice
- Prefer simple, informal words
- Keep the meaning same
- Break up overly long sentences or longer than 30 words.
- Use less than 30 words per sentence. Switch things like "due to the fact that" -> "because", "was not able to" -> "couldn't", "at this point in time" -> now, "is able to" -> can
- Use contractions. For example, switch "could not" -> "couldn't", "have not" -> "haven't", etc.
- Switch unnecessary nouns for verbs when possible. For example, "we made a decision to" -> we decided to, "we conducted an analysis of" -> "we analysed", "we provide help to customers" -> "we help customers"
- Switch formal for normal words. For example, "assistance" -> "help", "commence" -> "start", "in order to" -> "to", "obtain" -> "get", "provide" -> "give", "request" -> "ask", "require" -> "need", "resolve" -> "fix", "therefore" -> "so", "utilise" -> "use"
- Avoid formal words and phrases like "quite", "incorporating", "extremely", "incredibly", "it's already proving valuable", "invaluable", "proving invaluable", "proving"
- Using "really" is ok sometimes. You can consider removing it or if removing it wouldn't make sense, just call it out as a "weasel word" per the <suggestions>
- Avoid using parentheses mid sentence. Restructure the sentence to include the same content but avoid using parentheses since it breaks the chain of thought.
- Use verbs that embed the meaning of their adverbs. For example, “She spoke loudly” could be “She shouted.”
- Delete cases of "I think", "I believe", "It seems" and other weak phrasing.
- Delete cases of "to be" where possible. For example, "it has to be a good deal" -> "it must be a good deal." Or "there is going to be a party this evening" -> "there will be a party this evening."
- Avoid starting sentences with "there is" and "there are". For example, "there is avariable called met_trick that stores the current accuracy" -> "The met_trick variable stores the current accuracy", "there is no guarantee that the updates will be received in sequential order" -> "clients might not receive the updates in sequential order", "there is a lot of overlap between x and y" -> "x and y overlap a lot", "there is no creator stack for the main thread" -> "the main thread does not provide a creator stack"
- Delete adverbs when they don't change the meaning of the sentence. 
- Your suggestions should not result in longer sentences. For example, switching "So far there's 1 writing coach prompt in there, but it's really useful so far. It has writing samples from my newsletter and practical writing advice" to "The repo currently has one writing coach prompt. Though it's just getting started, it's already proving valuable. It includes writing samples from my newsletter and actionable writing advice" is bad advice because it makes the sentence longer and overly formal.

<suggestions>
**IMPORTANT: This takes higher precedence than the <instructions> above. Any callouts here should not be edited from the <instructions> above. Instead, we just want to notify the user.**

Only tell me about these, without editing them:
1. Weasel words like "increased significantly", "much faster", "extremely successful". Each of these would ideally get swapped to something more specific like "increased by 43%."
2. Repeating sentence length. Ideally, sentences vary in length to not become monotonous. Call out any areas where there are 3 or more back-to-back sentences with similar length.
3. For any instructional, numbered lists, call out if they don't start with imperative verbs.
4. Concerning phrases or sentences. Add any sentences or phrases you think can be improved, but you were too worried about changing the tone to edit it automatically.

<suggestions output format>
For each of these, call them out via nested bullets and the phrase with a few words before and after it. For example,
1. Weasel words
  - "Sales increased significantly in Q4"
  - "We made the application much faster"
  - "will make the endeavor extremely successful"
2. Repeating sentence length
  - { sentence 1 }, { sentence 2 }, { sentence 3 }
  - ...
3. Numbered lists
  - ...

If none are found, simply write "None found" as the first sub-bullet for the section.
</suggestions output format>
</suggestions>

<recap instructions>
After your edits, write a bullet-point summary of the key edits you did and why. Explain to help me understand how I can improve my writing by myself in the future.

Also explain how you did not dilute the original tone of the message.
</recap instructions>

<next steps>
If I do not provide writing for you to analyze after this, then ask me to provide it by saying:
"I'm ready to help improve your writing. Could you please provide the text you would like me to review and edit?"
